## 🎯 Objective

This material aims to reinforce concepts from courses such as Microprocessors through practical projects using Assembly language for the RISC-ARM architecture. The proposal is to explore direct hardware control — low-level programming in its purest form.

> \[!CAUTION]
> This content covers Bare Metal development on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B — meaning, without an operating system. Here, you will program the hardware directly. Ready for the challenge? Follow the instructions in Lesson 1 and start right away.
